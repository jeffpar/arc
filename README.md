# ARC 5.21q

Updated to [arc 5.21q-5 source package in Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/arc/5.21q-5) and then massaged the code to compile and run successfully with Xcode 14.2 on macOS Ventura 13.2.1.  There are still quite a few warnings, mostly regarding old prototypes, which I started to clean up but then decided to ignore.

The license was apparently "migrated" to GNU at some point, perhaps to make it compliant for release with Ubuntu.  Hopefully that was done in accordance with permissions granted by the original author (Thom Henderson, System Enhancement Associates).
